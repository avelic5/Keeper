##  **Description**

**Keeper** is a small React application I built as part of my initial learning journey in React and frontend development. The app allows users to create, view, and delete notes, helping me understand and practice core React concepts such as:

- Using components
- Managing state with `useState`
- Passing data between parent and child components via `props`
- Working with lists and events

## **Features**

- Add new notes with a title and content
- Delete individual notes
- View a pre-populated list of example notes
- Minimalist and responsive design

##  **Technologies Used**

- **React** – for building the user interface
- **Material-UI** – for buttons and icons
- **CSS** – for styling components

##  **Conclusion**

Keeper is my first practical step into React and frontend development. Through this app, I am learning how to manage components and state effectively. I aim to continue developing my skills and enhance both the design and functionality in future projects.
